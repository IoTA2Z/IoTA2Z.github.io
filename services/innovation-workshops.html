            </div>
            <div class="content">
              <h3>Compute Design/Selection</h3>
              <p>IOTA2Z IoT designs can be based on a multitude of processors depending on the requirements of the project.  These include X86, ARM, MIPS, TI, FPGA, PLCs, Atmel, SiLabs, NEC, PIC, etc.  We will work with you to evaluate the many tradeoffs involved with processor selection to insure we identify the best possible choice for your application.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">
              <h3>Custom I/O Design/Selection</h3>
              <p>There can be enormous variability in the I/O requirements of an IoT device.  Selecting the right combination of standardized and possibly customized I/O solutions, at an appropriate price point, and with an eye on your future product roadmap requirements is a critical set of decisions.  IOTA2Z’s broad experiences with I/O technologies such as USB, Wifi/802.11, Bluetooth, BLE, GPIO, analog, CAN, ANT+, Modbus, Z-wave, Zigbee, IDE, SATA as well as protocols such as CoAP, MQTT, DTLS, REST and others insures the most technically effective and cost optimal decisions are made, implemented and integrated.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">
              <h3>Embedded OS Design/Selection</h3>
              <p>While not strictly hardware development, proper OS selection is a critical layer between hardware and application software development that can have enormous implications for the robustness and full lifecycle cost of your IoT device.  Having worked with Linux, Micrium RTOS, FreeRTOS, Windows Embedded/CE, NuttX and bare metal systems to name a few, IOTA2Z can help insure the best possible decision is made here and can further tailor the composition and configuration of the chosen O.S. for your IoT environment.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">
              <h3>Custom Driver Development</h3>
              <p>Again, while not strictly hardware development, operating system support for uncommon devices is a frequent requirement for many IoT devices.  IOTA2Z has extensive experience developing custom drivers for a wide variety of device types and operating systems.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">
              <h3>Rapid Prototyping</h3>
              <p>After numerous complex design decisions and technology selections are made for your IoT device, and before you experience the cost of volume manufacturing, you must be sure the end result will optimally fulfil your project’s requirements.  IOTA2Z’s rapid prototyping service gives you a low risk, cost effective way of fully evaluating all aspects of a design and make any needed course corrections before you manufacture.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">
              <h3>FPGA Design</h3>
              <p>IOTA2Z has broad experience in FPGA design and development in applications such as high-speed communication protocols and interfaces, custom ASIC and peripheral integration/drivers, digital signal processing and algorithm optimization, image processing and object recognition, and “big data” real-time data stream processing.  We have worked with most of the popular FPGA tools including Xilinx ISE and Vivado, MicroBlaze, ChipScope, Iverilog, ModelSim, Matlab/Simulink, Altera Quartus/Prime, Qsys, SignalTap, and Lattice Diamond. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">
              <h3>PCB Design</h3>
              <p>IOTA2Z is the right choice for custom printed circuit design in your IoT device.  Our comprehensive PCB services include schematic capture, footprint and component library creation, PCB layout, manufacturer liaison, design modification/optimization and debugging.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">
              <h3>Hardware Test Packages</h3>
              <p>Whether your IoT solution is designed by IOTA2Z or not, we can develop and exercise full-featured hardware test environments and/or full-stack test environments to insure your IoT device functions as intended.  This can include correctness testing, performance testing, environmental testing, protocol testing, security testing, unplanned conditions and failure mode testing to name a few.  To the greatest extent possible, we focus on creating automated, repeatable testing packages to insure completeness and consistency in testing over the entire product lifecycle.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">
              <h3>Compliance Testing</h3>
              <p>If your particular IoT device requires various forms of compliance testing (e.g. security, FCC, GDPR, CUI, DFARS, etc), IOTA2Z can help you understand the involved processes, perform testing or shepherd 3rd party testing, and successfully complete these processes quickly and efficiently.</p>
